# Knapsack Analysis in Rust

For my algorithms class in college, [I implemented a version of the knapsack problem in python](https://github.com/willtraweek/KnapsackAnalysis). Since that's such a computationally intensive problem (especially at scale), I figured it would be a good idea to make my first Rust project a rewrite of that application in Rust, then compare the speed at which the two function.

Of course, a good amount of this is going to be dependent on how exactly I optimize parts of this, so I may run multiple tests at different stages to see what optimizations make the most improvement. I'll make sure to include a table below here as the project evolves with links to the application at various stages so that future readers can see the improvements over time.
